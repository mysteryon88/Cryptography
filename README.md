### Polybius

Implementation of Russian message encryption using Polybius Square

### RSA

Implementation of a simple version of the RSA algorithm, organized through files

### RC4

Implementation of a simple version of the RC4 algorithm, it is possible to generate a new random key

### Diffie-Hellman

The simplest implementation of the diffie-hellman protocol, class fields should be private, but public for clarity

### TinyHash

A simple implementation of a hash function for another project, the hash can be generated in different lengths (HASH_LEN)

### Vigenère cipher

My first golang program. Latin-only implementation of the Vigenère cipher.

### PS-network

The algorithm encrypts pictures in size multiples of a power of two, you can adjust the number of rounds and block size

### Elliptic Curve

Elliptic Curve $y^2 = x^3 - a*x + b$ where $4a^3 + 27b^2≠0$.
Added Point addition and Scalar multiplication in R and GF

### Paye cryptosystem

Partially homomorphic cryptosystem

### ECDSA

Recovering a private key from an address that erred in creating a signature and reused the parameter k + Create a signature

### HMAC

Simple implementations of two hash-based signature systems

### NTRU

Tutorial implementation of the NTRU algorithm (lattice based cryptography)

Does not always decrypt, the problem is in the choice of the polynomial $r(x)$

### Chaum-Pedersen

A simple implementation of the non-interactive Chaum-Pedersen protocol.

The protocol proves that two different discrete logarithms are equivalent without revealing the logarithms themselves:

$log_g(p)=log_h(p)$

### Shamir's secret sharing

Realization of a threshold scheme for secret partitioning

### Fiat-Shamir Protocol

Implementing a zero-knowledge protocol in python and running 20 rounds.
